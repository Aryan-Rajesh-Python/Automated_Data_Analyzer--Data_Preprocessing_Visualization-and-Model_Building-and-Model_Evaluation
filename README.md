# Comprehensive Data Analysis, Preprocessing, Machine Learning Model Building, and Prediction Platform with Interactive Visualization

## Overview

The **Comprehensive Data Analysis, Preprocessing, Machine Learning Model Building, and Prediction Platform with Interactive Visualization** is an interactive web-based application built using **Streamlit**. It provides end-to-end solutions for data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model building. This tool is designed for both beginners and advanced users, simplifying complex tasks in the machine learning pipeline.

## Features

### File Support
- Supports **CSV**, **Excel**, and **JSON** file formats.
- Automatic data type inference and correction for seamless integration.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Handling**: Options include dropping rows or filling with mean, median, or mode.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detect outliers using **IQR**, **Z-score**, or **Isolation Forest** methods.
- **High Cardinality Handling**: Bucket rare categories for categorical columns with more than a set number of unique categories.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Choose between **Label Encoding** or **One-Hot Encoding**.
- **Feature Scaling**: Support for **StandardScaler**, **MinMaxScaler**, and **RobustScaler**.
- **Time-Series Processing**: Automatically extracts year, month, and day features for datetime columns.

### Data Visualization
- **Numeric Columns**: 
  - Histogram, KDE (Kernel Density Estimation), Box plots, and Pair plots (scatter matrix).
- **Categorical Columns**: 
  - Bar plots and Count plots.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualize relationships between numeric features.

### Machine Learning
- Supports both **Classification** and **Regression** tasks.
- Choose from a variety of models:
  - **Random Forest**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, **Neural Networks**, **Logistic Regression**, and more.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Built-in grid search for model optimization.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate models with 5-fold cross-validation.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Leverage **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for oversampling.

### Model Evaluation
- **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
- **Regression Metrics**: MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RÂ² Score.
- **ROC-AUC**: Binary and multi-class ROC curves with AUC scores.

### Advanced Features
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Dimensionality reduction with 2D visualization.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Stopword removal.
- **NLP Transformers**: Support for text classification using pre-trained models like **DistilBERT**.

### Save and Predict
- Save trained models, scalers, and encoders for future use.
- Upload new datasets for prediction with trained pipelines.
