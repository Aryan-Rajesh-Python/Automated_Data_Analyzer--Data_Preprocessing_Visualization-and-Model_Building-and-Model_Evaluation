# Data Preprocessing and Data Visualization and Machine Learning model building and Model Evaluation Web App

A Streamlit-based web application for data preprocessing and machine learning tasks. The app allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, and train machine learning models (classification and regression). It also includes model evaluation and comparison.

## Features

- **Dataset Upload**: Upload CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale data.
- **Model Training**: Train classification and regression models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate with metrics like accuracy, F1 score, RMSE, and RÂ².
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimization.
- **Visualization**: Display confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.
- **Predictions**: Input new data as a csv file directly into the application to make real-time predictions using the trained model.
